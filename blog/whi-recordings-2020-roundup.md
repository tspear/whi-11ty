## Events
I took part in 3 instalments of THE DARK OUTSIDE - 24 hour livestreams of previously unheard material. These were the catalyst for the TX releases.


The track “Surrey Administration Facility” was included on Gated Canal Community’s epic 5 album compilation “Isolation and Rejection”

In November the Kites & Pylons weird weekend took place. My track “TX 11” was a 20 minute version of the TX device.


## Radio play and sessions:

In July I did my first guest mix for urban mutant:
