# 2021 End of Year review

Hello friends, hope you all had a great Christmas break and got all the synths and vinyl you were hoping for.

It’s time for my roundup of the year for WHI recordings…

## Releases

There were 2 releases from Secret Nuclear in 2021:

## Key points EP

Released in May, the Key Points EP slipped under the radar. 3 tracks of sparse, tense sounds direct from a nighttime improv, recorded in single takes.

Download free or pay what you like:

## Insider EP

Following in July, “Insider EP” was the most popular release to date, with plenty of radio plays and downloads.

There was even a first review in WIRE magazine - describing the EP as “a space age murder mystery narrated by a sleek digital hi-hat”

## Space folk horror lounge:

I was lucky enough to be invited to contribute to Darren Gidding’s excellent radio show “The Space Folk Horror Lounge”. For the December “lock-in” special I made a mix spanning the whole WHI history, from my first electronic tracks through to future releases.

Look out for a demo version of a track from the new Secret Nuclear album at the end:

## WHI on CAMP

In February I started my new show for CAMP, a radio station which broadcasts from an arts facility in the French Pyrenees. All shows are released on Mixcloud and there is an amazing array of experimental music shows spanning all genres.

The WHI show is quarterly and showcases great new electronic music that I’ve been discovering throughout the year.

The next show is January 11.

## Coming up in 2022

There are plenty of projects lined up for next year:

## Insider live

Look out for a live session version of the Insider EP, which will be played in full by a radio show you will know well, somewhere near Warminster. There may well be actual SN live shows, too…

## Collabs

I’ve been collaborating on projects with the amazing Matt Irwin of BALTIC FURS, including a full length release arriving sometime in the new year.


## Secret Nuclear album

I know I said this last year, but the Secret Nuclear album is nearing completion, promise! One of my goals for 2022 for Secret Nuclear is to make some physical releases, so watch this space…


## Highlight of the year

We were lucky to make it up to Whitby in November for the Levitation Festival weekend, from the wonderful Castles in Space label. It was amazing to see some of my favourite artists such as Warrington Runcorn New Town Development Plan and Field Lines Cartographer in the flesh. The whole weekend was an absolute triumph.

That’s it for the roundup, don’t forget to Follow us on bandcamp for all new releases and updates. I aim to update Bandcamp followers before other channels, and there may well be a few follower-only releases in the new year.
